#### ASSIGNMENT 8: Esemble Learning: Regression Models & Bias–Variance Trade-off & Overview

Problem Statement

Train and evaluate multiple regression models on a dataset to:

Establish a baseline model (Decision Tree and Linear Regression).

Implement Bagging (variance reduction).

Implement Boosting (bias reduction).

Implement Stacking (combining multiple learners).

Compare all models based on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and discuss results.
